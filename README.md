# Predicting Online Sales

The objective if this project was to use webtraffic data to predict customer purchasing beahvior for a hypothetical online retailer. The company will tailor their advertising based on these predictions, and advertising will be targeted to those customers who have already visited the company website. When the model results in an inaccurate revenue prediction, the company needlessly spends advertising revenue. This project utilizes both Decision Tree and Naive Bayes methods for prediction. The final recommended Decision Tree model, which corrected for class imbalance, correctly predicted who would purchase from the company in 80% of cases, and was able to predict who would not purchase from the company in 86% of cases.
